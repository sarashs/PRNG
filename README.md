# PRNG

This is a tutorial on implementing a XORWOW random number generator using Axi-Lite on a PYNQ-Z1 (ZYNQ-7000) FPGA board.

Vivado version 2020.1 and PYNQ version 2.6 are required for this project.

There is also a youtube video where I try to describe the procedure:

To use the files: Source the .tcl file in vivado to build the project. Alternatively, use the precompiled .bit and .hwh files. Run the jupyter notebook on your pynq-z1.
